!!! I'm currently working on the README file on how everything needs to be setup and configured !!!


First of all this was never setup to be a portable solution that would work on any configuration. The way it's setup works good for my setup. It may not work for you out of the box. If you have no programming knowledge it maybe be difficult to get it working. I've only tested this in combination with PS5 it may or may not work correctly with PS4 or just may need some tuning for the sleep values.

# Remote play setup
The script works in combination with the Chiaki remote play client.
